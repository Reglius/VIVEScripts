YOU HAVE TO DOWNLOAD NIRCMD.EXE for it to work, it is on my github and ISNT MY WORK

You only have to change the discord part if you arent using it... if you arent using discord then it wont do anything
Discord has to be closed for the changes to take place that is why the script kills it, just open it again after the script runs
the vive script should not need to be changed
for headphones just edit where it is specified, pretty self explanitory, put in the name of your headphone source
right click on speaker icon on bottom right of screen > playback devices > which ever one is checked with a green mark > copy that name to headphone part
click on record > which ever one is checked with a green mark > copy that name to mic part
