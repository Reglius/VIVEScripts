This script is made for discord and discord has to be closed for the changes to take place. This script kills it and you need to open it again after the script runs.
The "Vive.bat" script *should* not need to be changed when running.

In case you need to change the sources, in the name of your headphone source, only delete the stuff inside of the quotes not the "" marks themselves.

---*to find your input and output source*---
1. Right click on speaker icon on bottom right of screen.
