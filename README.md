YOU HAVE TO DOWNLOAD NIRCMD.EXE for it to work, it is on my github and ISNT MY WORK

this is made for discord, if you arent using discord then you probably have to manually restart your chat service to talk to friends in vr

Discord has to be closed for the changes to take place that is why the script kills it, just open it again after the script runs
the vive script *should* not need to be changed

for headphones just edit where it is specified, pretty self explanitory, put in the name of your headphone source only delete the stuff inside of the quotes not the "" marks themselves

---*to find your headphone source*---

right click on speaker icon on bottom right of screen > playback devices > which ever one is checked with a green mark > copy that name to headphone part

click on record > which ever one is checked with a green mark > copy that name to mic part
